This  Directory contains  a list of sample coding challeges of the Geeks for Geeks C++ Course,  with project requirements that i have to solve and my respective solutions

****************
### Project 1: C++ Basics
C++ Hello World

Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 76.1%Submissions: 103K+Points: 1
Let's begin your journey towards coding with the very first question of the coding world. Your task is to write code that prints Hello World.

Example 1:

Input:
No Input
Output:
Hello World
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Your Task:
In the function helloWorld(), output a line "Hello World" (without quotes).

### Project 2: C++ Basics
Taking input
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 72.93%Submissions: 47K+Points: 2
Before implementing any algorithm, we should be thorough with taking inputs. Here, we will learn how to read inputs.
You are given two inputs: a(integer), and b(string). You need to take the input and print a and b separated by a space.

Note: You have to print a new line at the end after prinintg a and b.

Example 1:

Input:
a = 5
b = Hello
Output:
5 Hello
Example 2:

Input:
a = 7
b = Geeks
Output:
7 Geeks
Expected time complexity: O(1)
Expected auxiliary space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= a <= 106

### Project 3: C++ Basics
GetLine and Ignore
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 45.95%Submissions: 32K+Points: 2
There are many times when we need to take input of a string that contains multiple words.
Here, we will learn how to take input of a string that comprises of multiple words. Also, we will learn to clear the input buffer. Your task is to take input of strings and integers and produce the output.

Note : Use std:cin, getline(), cin.ignore().
Note 2: When cin is followed by getline, it creates a problem that can be circumvented by using cin.ignore. You can read more about it here

Input Format:
First line of input contains T,  number of testcases. For each testcase, there will be three lines of input. First line contains string, second line contains integer, and third line again contains string.

Output Format:
For each testcase, print the variables in same order as taken in input.

User Task:
Your task is to complete the function getLineAndIgnore() to take input of strings and learn how and when to use cin.ignore().

Example:
Input:
1
hello world
5
hello

Output:
hello world
5
hello

### Project 4: C++ Basics
Learning Macros
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 87.3%Submissions: 34K+Points: 2
Macro is one of the most important part of CPP preprocessors. It allows us to define variables and functions and it basically works by substituting the value or function during the preprocessing stage of code conversion(High level to Low level). So, let's dive into preprocessors!

You are given two inputs: a(integer),and b(integer). You need to print a * b .

Input Format:
First line of input conatins number of testcases T. For each testcase, there will be one line of input containing a and b.

Output Format:
For each testcase, print a*b.

User Task:
Your task is to complete the provided function .

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= a,b <= 100

Input:
2
5 6
7 11

Output:
30
77

### Project 5: C++ Basics
Logical Operators
Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 68.01%Submissions: 22K+Points: 1
Logical operators are used when we want to check the truth value of certain statements. Logical operators help us in checking multiple statements together for their truthness.

Here we will learn logical operators like AND(&&), OR(||), NOT(!). These operators produce either a true or a false as an output.

Example:

Input:
a = 6
b = 7
Output:1 1 0
Explanation:a && b = 1
a || b = 1
(!a) && (!b) = 0
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the provided function.

Constraints:
1 <= a, b,<= 100
****************************************************************************
### Project 6: C++ Basics
Armstrong Numbers
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 49.88%Submissions: 164K+Points: 2
You are given a 3-digit number n, Find whether it is an Armstrong number or not.

An Armstrong number of three digits is a number such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. 371 is an Armstrong number since 33 + 73 + 13 = 371. 

Note: Return true if it is an Armstrong number else return false.

Examples

Input: n = 153
Output: true
Explanation: 153 is an Armstrong number since 13 + 53 + 33 = 153. 
Input: n = 372
Output: false
Explanation: 372 is not an Armstrong number since 33 + 73 + 23 = 378. 
Input: n = 100
Output: false
Explanation: 100 is not an Armstrong number since 13 + 03 + 03 = 1. 
Constraints:
100 â‰¤ n <1000
